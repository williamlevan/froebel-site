                            <p>The most important of our endeavors is to spend time reading with the younger classes and tutoring the older students. If you can tutor regularly, you will be assigned a specific classroom that you will support. If you can't come on a regular basis, come on any available school days. Bring your friends and spend some time at school with our students! NOTE: scheduling is flexible!!! Come for any amount of time, on any day. <strong>WHEN YOU REGISTER</strong>, please note in the comments what days/time you will attend!</p>

                            <p>Throughout the school year we support Froebel Elementary with supply drives for books, school supplies, and clothing items, including our biggest project, providing each student with a holiday gift bag. These items are sorted and stored in a warehouse in the Brentwood Industrial Court. On scheduled days, we meet at the warehouse to unpack and organize the donations, sort books by age and reading level, and pack the holiday bags. These 200+ bags are distributed in December at school to the families of each student.</p>
